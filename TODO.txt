- Hello team! I created this file to record our todo list in the future. 
  I created a dev branch for development in order to have a reliable version
  control during our project development. Every time we need to deliver a 
  iteration, we merge the dev branch to the master. The 'bug' and 'feature' 
  branch will be created in the future if needed. 
  
  Thanks for reading and have a nice weekend!
